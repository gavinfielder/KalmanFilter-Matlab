I have rewritten both the matlab script and the C program of the kalman filter to be 2-dimensional and provided an intial estimate of the process noise covariance matrices Q for each axis of the accelerometer and gyroscope data that was collected on Nov 17th. 

The matlab script is now kalmandev_v4.m
The C program is in kalmanfilter_c_1218.zip

I've also re-uploaded the data I collected on Nov 17th. This is data_2017-11-17.zip
