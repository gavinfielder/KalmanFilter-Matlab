While porting the kalman filter to C, I noticed in my previous kalman filter I 
accidentally was using the forward derivative instead of the backward derivative. 
After fixing this, the kalman filter no longer works as effectively.

I've uploaded the new version, which uses the rear derivative.

I've also uploaded the kalman filter in C code. It is currently an identical 
algorithm to kalmandev_v3 matlab script. It appears to only reduce about 10-20%
of noise. 

Future work:
    1. Get it working effectively again. 
       
       This might be as simple as finding the proper process noise covariance 
       marix (Q) setting.

       But the previous method I found accidentally for setting Q is no longer
       as effective, either. 

       Another possibility is to take the kalman filter down to a 2-dimensional 
       state estimation and then run a 3-dimensional optimization problem to
       optimize Q. 

       As a final note, my matlab script still uses the forward derivative to
       come up with the baseline measurement noise covariance matrix R, and the
       R I measured with the forward derivative is also ported to the C code.
       I don't think using the forward derivative with the baseline would pose
       any issue, since it's a steady state, but it's something to note.
