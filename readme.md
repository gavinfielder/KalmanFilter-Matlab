# Kalman Filter Development in Matlab

This is part of the unmanned bicycle project at CSU Chico. The kalman filter algorithm we used for a while was initially developed in Matlab and tested against sample data collected in November 2017.

Matlab, of course, has its own kalman filter algorithm but the object here was to develop a kalman filter for  the unmanned bicycle, which is an embedded system. The files for the microcontroller software were written in C. Those files are included in this repo in a zip.

You can read about the kalman filter method in general [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).
