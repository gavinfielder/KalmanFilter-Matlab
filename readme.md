# Kalman Filter Development in Matlab

This is part of the unmanned bicycle project at CSU Chico. The kalman filter algorithm we used for a while was initially developed in Matlab and tested against sample data collected in November 2017.

You can read about the kalman filter method in general [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).
